# LinguaSnapp Mobile App Redistributable

This is the source code for the LinguaSnapp mobile application. This version can be dsitributed to other institutions as it has had all references to Manchester systems and dependencies removed. If you are looking for the University of Manchester hosted versions (for Manchester, Jerusalem and Melbourne) then the source code can be found in the [sister repository](https://github.com/UoMResearchIT/LinguaSnapp-Xamarin-Mobile).

The legacy version of the app (v1.X) is a Javascript/jQuery Mobile application written for PhoneGap and to be compiled on PhoneGap Build.

The current version (v2.X) is written using Xamarin.Forms 5.0 and can be built using Visual Studio and the .NET stack.

Installation and configuration documentation is in [the Wiki](https://github.com/UoMResearchIT/LinguaSnapp-Distribution-Mobile/wiki).
